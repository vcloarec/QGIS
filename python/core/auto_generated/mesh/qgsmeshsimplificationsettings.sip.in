    bool isEnabled() const;

Returns if the overview is active

Sets if the overview is active

%Docstring
Returns the reduction factor used to build simplified mesh.
%End

    void setReductionFactor( double value );
%Docstring
Sets the reduction factor used to build simplified mesh.
The triangles count of the simplified mesh equals apromativly the triangles count of base mesh divised by this factor.
This reduction factor is used for simplification of each successive simplified mesh. For  example, if the base mesh has 5M faces,
and the reduction factor is 10, the first simplified mesh will have approximativly 500 000 faces, the second 50 000 faces,
the third 5000, ...
If highter reduction factor leads to simpler meshes, it produces also fewer levels of detail.
The reduction factor has to be strictly greater than 1. If not, the simplification processus will render nothing.

Writes configuration to a new DOM element

%Docstring
Reads configuration from the given DOM element
%End

    int meshResolution() const;
%Docstring
Returns the mesh resolution e.i., the minimum size (average) of triangles in pixels
%End

    void setMeshResolution( int meshResolution );
%Docstring
Sets the mesh resolution e.i., the minimum size (average) of triangles in pixels
This value is used during map rendering to choose the most appropriate mesh from he list of simplified mesh.
The first mesh which has its average triangle size greater this value will be chosen.
